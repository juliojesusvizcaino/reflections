What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Because without it, you can't create commits, so you can't use version control with git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is different from the working directory in the sense that it doesn't exist as a directory does, and it is different from the repository because it is a previous area to it.
