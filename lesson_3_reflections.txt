When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to colaborate whith other people and when I work in different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I think that there isn't a cause.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	The differences are that branches doesn't repeat commits like clones and forks. Between forks and clones, they are the same, but in differents platforms
